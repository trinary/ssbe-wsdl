SemiHierarchicalRoutes
======================

This plugin provides support for semi hierarchical resources.  Semi
hierarchical resources have the collection and new URIs below the URI
of a resource of a different type, but the member resources themselves
are located at the top level.  For example,

    http://example.com/user/42/address
    http://example.com/address/24b

The first URI references a collection of all the address belonging to
user 42 and the second references a specific address.

Semi hierarchical resources are specified using the
`:partition_collection_by` option to #resources method.  The value of
the `:partition_collection_by` option may be

 * a symbol that matches a existing named route
 * an array of symbols each of which matches a named route
 * a hash of collection resource options keyed on symbols, each of
   which matches a named route.

The following collection resource options are supported

 `:no_create`
 : prevents the creation of routes involved in creating member
   resources for the collection for which this option is specified

The routes create for partitioned collections call action methods
named `index_by_<partition_criterion>`,
`create_by_<partition_criterion>` and `new_by_<partition_criterion>`,
rather than the plain index, create and new methods.


Example
=======

    ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
      map.resources :genders
      map.resources :universities
      map.resources :people, :partition_collection_by=>[:gender, :university]
      map.resources :books, :partition_collection_by=>{:person=>{:no_create}}
    end

Produces the normal routes for genders, universities, individual
people and individual books.  Additionally, it produces routes for
gender and university specific people collections, and people specific
book collections.  The people specific book collections do not have
route for new or create actions.

    GET, POST  http://.../genders/:gender_id/people
    GET        http://.../genders/:gender_id/people/new
    GET, POST  http://.../universities/:university_id/people
    GET        http://.../universities/:university_id/people/new
    GET        http://.../person/:person_id/books
